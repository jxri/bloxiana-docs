<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Get the username of your target">
    Find the **Roblox username** (not display name) of the player you want to snipe.  
    They **must be online and currently playing a game**.

    ![Step 1 Image](/images/sniping/step1.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the game link/ID">
    Copy the **URL/ID of the game** they **may** be playing.  
    This tells the bot which game to search in.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste user and game info into the command">
    Use the slash command `/snipe` with both the username and the game.

    Format:
    ```
    /snipe target:[username] game:[game]
    ```

    Example:  
    ```
    /snipe target:bloxianalol game:11158043705
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for the bot to scan servers">
    Bloxiana will scan hundreds (or thousands) of servers to find your target.  
    Be patient—this can take several seconds (or up to 5 minutes) depending on the game.

    ![Step 4 Image](https://i.postimg.cc/Gt2kKvfX/IMG-9638.jpg)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Join your target's server">
    If found, click the **“Join”** button.  
    - On desktop: Opens a Bloxiana join link.
    - On mobile: Tap “Yes” when prompted to open in Roblox.

# Common Sniping Questions & Errors

---

## 🔍 "Search expired"

The bot searched for 5 minutes but could not locate the user in the game.

- The user may have left the game, joined a private server, or you entered the wrong game.
- You’ll need to rerun the command.

---

## 🧠 What is "Deepsearch"?

If a quick scan doesn’t find the player, the bot activates **Deepsearch**.

- It continues searching across more servers.
- Takes longer, but increases the chance of finding someone in large/private lobbies.
- You’ll see a message like: `Deepsearch enabled... Scanning further.`

---

## ❌ "Player not in game"

The bot couldn’t verify that the user is currently in a game.

- Double-check that they are online and actively playing.

---

## ❌ "Failed to fetch user information"

This usually means:

- The username doesn't exist
- You entered a display name instead of a username

---

## ✅ "Player found" (Public Joins)

If the user’s joins are public, you’ll get a direct link to join their current session—even if the game doesn't match your input.

- This override happens to help you snipe quickly regardless of game input.

---

## 🔁 "Retrying..."

The bot is reattempting the search due to:

- Temporary data delays
- The user rapidly joining/leaving servers

Just wait—it will continue searching.

---

## ❌ "Player left game"

The player left the game during the search process.

- Try sniping them again when they're in another game.

---

## ❌ "No match found"

The bot was unable to locate any server with the specified user.

- Double-check username and game input.
- It may take a second attempt with Deepsearch.

---

## ❌ "Currently being sniped by another user"

Only one user can snipe a target at a time. Try again later.

---

## 🚫 "Game blacklisted"

This game cannot be sniped due to performance concerns.

- Usually applies to massive games (like Grow a Garden) that would slow down the system for everyone.

---

## 🚫 "User is blacklisted"

This user is protected from being sniped.

- Blacklisted users are often developers, content creators, or users being harassed by others using the bot.

---

## ❌ "Canceled"

The snipe was canceled by the user who initiated it.

- Only the initiator can cancel the process.
